Abstract

   This document provides operational guidelines for designing Segment
   Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) addressing plans in
   Internet-service-provider backbones of up to 50 000 nodes.  It
   specifies a compressed Segment Identifier (C-SID) locator structure
   (F3216) that encodes Flex-Algo, Region-ID, Site-ID and Node-ID inside
   a fixed /48 locator while leaving space for Local and Global C-SIDs.
   An “ultra-scale” profile (~300 000 nodes) using End.LBS locator-block
   swap is also defined.  The aim is to accelerate brown-field SRv6
   migrations by offering deterministic field carving, summarisation
   rules and actionable operational guidance.
